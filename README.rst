Library that talks to multiple databases to use for data pipelines and etl


Description
===========


Forget about boiler plate code to setup and tear database connections:
This library will give you all the basic methods to pull and push data from various types of database
Initial release will support Postgres and Mysql.
I will focus on python 3.7 just to discourage people from continuing the python 2.7 train.
Move to 3.6+ and get learn something new.
